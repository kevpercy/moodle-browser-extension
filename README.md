# Moodle Tracker Browser Extension

This extension adds functionality to search and find issues in Moodle tracker easily.

## Usage

### From the search bar

You can search for tracker issues from the search bar directly, by prefixing your query with "mdl ". If you enter an issue number you will be directed to that issue. For everything else you will be directed to the search results.

For example:

"mdl 12345" will take you to issue MDL-12345.

"mdl MDLQA-12345" will take you to issue MDLQA-12345.

"mdl gradebook" will take you to the search results page for "gradebook".

### From the extension icon

Clicking on the extension icon will display a search form. You can search for an issue number or search terms here, which will work the same way as the search bar. Results will be displayed in a new tab.

For example:

"12345" will take you to issue MDL-12345.

"MDLQA-12345" will take you to issue MDLQA-12345.

"gradebook" will take you to the search results page for "gradebook".
